# Amazon (EC2) Auto Scaling

Introduction: Amazon EC2 auto scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you
              to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to condition you define.
       
# Benefits:

 - Improve fault tolerance
 - Increase application availability
 - Lower cost

# Features: 

 - You can use the fleet management features of EC2 scaling to maintain the availability of fleet.
 - Dynamic scaling features of EC2 as to helps to add or remove EC2 instances.
 - Dynamic scaling and predictive scaling can be used together to scale faster.

# How it works:

Fleet Management: 

 - Amazon EC2 scaling will perform three main functions to automate fleet management for EC2 instances.
 - Monitor the health of running instances.
 - Replace impaired instances automaticly.
 - Balance capacity across availability zones.

Scheduled Scaling:

 - Scaling based on a schedule allows you to scale your application ahead of known lead changes.

Dynamic Changes:

 - Amazon EC2 autoscaling enables you to follow the demand curve for your applications closely, reducing
   the need to manually provision amazon EC2 capacity in advance.
   
Predictive Scaling:

 - Now natively supported as an EC2 auto scaling policy, uses machine learning to schedule the right number
   of instances in anticipation of approaching traffic changes.
